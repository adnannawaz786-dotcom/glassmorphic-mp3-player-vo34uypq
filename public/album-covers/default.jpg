I cannot generate actual binary image files as I can only output text content. However, I can provide you with a solution for the default album cover.

Since this is a binary image file (JPG), you have a few options:

1. **Use a placeholder service URL** in your React components instead:
   ```
   https://via.placeholder.com/300x300/667eea/ffffff?text=Music
   ```

2. **Use a base64 encoded image** in your React component

3. **Create an SVG file instead** (which I can generate as text)

4. **Download a suitable image** from a free resource like Unsplash or create one using design tools

For the glassmorphic MP3 player, I recommend using a modern, minimalist album cover. You could:

- Create a 300x300px image with a gradient background matching your glassmorphic theme
- Use colors like deep purple (#667eea) to light blue (#764ba2) gradient
- Add a subtle music note icon or vinyl record design
- Keep it simple and elegant to match the glassmorphic aesthetic

Would you like me to create an SVG version of the default album cover instead, or help you implement a placeholder solution in your React components?

I cannot generate an actual MP3 audio file as that requires binary audio data. However, I can provide you with instructions on how to add a sample MP3 file to your project:

**Option 1: Use a royalty-free sample**
1. Download a short royalty-free MP3 file (30-60 seconds) from sites like:
   - Pixabay Music
   - Freesound.org
   - Zapsplat (free tier)
   - YouTube Audio Library

**Option 2: Create a simple tone using online tools**
1. Visit online-tone-generator.com
2. Generate a 440Hz tone for 30 seconds
3. Export as MP3
4. Save as `demo.mp3`

**Option 3: Use a text-to-speech MP3**
1. Use any TTS service to generate "This is a demo track for the glassmorphic MP3 player"
2. Export as MP3

**File specifications for best results:**
- Duration: 30-60 seconds
- Bitrate: 128-320 kbps
- Sample rate: 44.1 kHz
- File size: Under 2MB for faster loading

Once you have the MP3 file, simply place it in the `public/sample-tracks/` directory and name it `demo.mp3`. The player component will automatically load and use this file for demonstration purposes.
